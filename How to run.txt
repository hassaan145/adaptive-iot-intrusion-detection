How to Run the Code:

1. Open Google Colab.
2. Create a new notebook.
3. Enable GPU by going to:

		Runtime → Change runtime type → Hardware accelerator → GPU


4. Mount Google Drive by running:

		from google.colab import drive
		drive.mount('/content/drive')


5. Make sure the dataset files KDDTrain+.txt and KDDTest+.txt are stored in your Drive inside a folder named:

		/content/drive/MyDrive/nsl-kdd/


6. Install required packages by running:

!pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib


7. Copy and paste the full Python code into the notebook.
8. Run the code from top to bottom in the notebook.
9. The PSO feature selection will run first.
10.Then the main deep learning model will train.
11.After training is complete, the accuracy results and the performance comparison plot will be displayed.
